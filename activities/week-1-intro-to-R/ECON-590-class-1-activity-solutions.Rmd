## Using `R` Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute 
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by 
placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# You can write and run sample code here

x <- 2

x**3

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by 
pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be 
saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to 
preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. 
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, 
the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Load and Subset Sample Data using `dplyr`

Now we want to demonstrate several data cleaning tasks using `dplyr` functions. 
We'll start by removing variables from our data set, then demonstrate how to 
create a subset of the data (a limited set of observations from our broader 
data set, selected based on some critieria).

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse package

library(tidyverse)

# Load .csv file stored via course GitHub

sample.data <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackaytc/econ-590-resources/main/data/ACS-4k-obs-sample-data.csv"))

# We want to make the data set a bit smaller and more manageable for today.
# Let's start by using the select command to keep only "year", "state", and
# "incwage" variables

sample.data <- select(sample.data, year, state, incwage) 

# The head() command will show us a snapshot of what the data set looks like

head(sample.data)

# Suppose we wanted to subset the data so that we only kept observations that
# lived in New York. To do this, we can use the filter() function to create a
# new object "sample.data.NY" that stores our subsetted data.

sample.data.NY <- filter(sample.data, state == "new york")

# Take a look at the new data set stored in the "Environment" window. Are all
# the observations from New York?

head(sample.data.NY)

# We can also use filter() to select observations by numeric values. This time,
# we won't create a new object - we'll just output the result using head().

head(filter(sample.data, incwage > 20000))

```

## Practice Problems

Using our sample data set, answer the following questions. Before you get 
started on the activity, take a look at the `dplyr` cheat sheet posted on the 
course GitHub page.

__1) Using the `mean()` function, report the average wage income for everyone in
our sample__

```{r}
# Base-R approach 

mean(sample.data$incwage)

# tidyverse using the summarize() function

incwage.stats <- summarize(sample.data, avg.incwage = mean(incwage))

# summarize() returns a data object that can store multiple summary stats (we'll 
# see why this is useful later). In this case, its just storing mean wages, 
# which we've named "avg.incwage". You can print the resulting data object:

incwage.stats

# We can all print just the value of mean wages, using the $-notation below 
# after the variable name to return the average value of incwage

incwage.stats$avg.incwage

```
We mentioned in class that wages in the ACS are _top-coded_ - income over a 
certain level isn't reported. Instead, the ACS reports an income value of 
`incwage = 999999`. We can set those values equal to missing (`NA`) and see 
how this changes the mean. 

```{r}
# Set top-coded wages equal to missing using the replace() function

sample.data.missings <- sample.data %>% 
  mutate(incwage = replace(incwage, incwage == 999999, NA))

# Now we need to use the "na.rm = TRUE" option to tell R that we want to ignore
# missing / NA values of incwage when calculating average wages

mean(sample.data.missings$incwage, na.rm = T)

```

__2) Using the `filter()` function, report the average wage income for everyone 
in our sample who lives in Florida__

```{r}
# Using tidyverse and %>% operator -- note that we'll use the data object with 
# missing income values sample.data.missings

FL.incwage.stats <- sample.data.missings %>%        # Start with sample data...
  filter(state == "florida")             %>%        # keep only FL observations
  summarize(avg.wage = mean(incwage, na.rm = TRUE)) # compute average income

# summarize() stores data objects. Again, you can print the resulting data object 

FL.incwage.stats

# Or you can add `$mean.wage` to print just the numeric value of mean wages

FL.incwage.stats$avg.wage

```

__3) Report the average wage income from observations who were surveyed between 
the years 2004 and 2008.__

_HINT:_ You can use `&` to add multiple restrictions in your `filter()` command.

```{r}
# One way - use filter() to create a new data object with obsevations only from
# the years 2004 to 2008, then take the average of the incwage variable

data.04.08 <- filter(sample.data.missings, year <= 2008 & year >= 2004)

# Base-R syntax 

mean(data.04.08$incwage, na.rm = TRUE)

# Another way - skip creating a new intermediate data object and just directly 
# calculate average wages using the %>% operator

incwage.04.08.stats <- sample.data.missings %>% 
  filter(year <= 2008 & year >= 2004)    %>% 
  summarize(avg.wage = mean(incwage, na.rm = TRUE)) 

# tidyverse syntax using summarize function -- returns a data object named 
# incwage.04.08.stats - the specific value we want is avg.wage, so we can
# type the following:

incwage.04.08.stats$avg.wage

```

__4) Report the average wage for everyone who lived in Florida, Alabama, or 
Georgia.__

HINT: You could use the `&`-syntax from (3) above, but that would get cumbersome 
if you had a longer list of states. Instead, take a look how we defined 
`b.vector` above. You can create a similar object named state.list that stores 
the values of the three states (with each state name in parentheses and 
separated by commas). Because we're now telling R to look over a list of 
states as opposed to a single state, use `%in%` instead of `==`.

```{r}
# Define the list of states we want to include in our sub-sample

state.list <- c("florida", "alabama", "georgia")

# Tell R to filter the data by looking for every observation that lived in one
# of the states listed in the state.list vector using (using %in% instead of ==)

data.FL.AL.GA <- filter(sample.data.missings, state %in% state.list)

# Now calculate average wages

mean(data.FL.AL.GA$incwage, na.rm = T)

```

__5) Using the `dplyr` cheat sheet on GitHub, calculate the median, 
minimum and maximum values of the `incwage` variable__

```{r}
# In the example below, we can why using summarize() and returning a data object
# of results is useful - here, summary.stats gives us a data object of all the 
# summary stats we want to calculate. 

summary.stats <- sample.data.missings %>% 
  summarize(min.wage = min(incwage, na.rm = TRUE), 
            max.wage = max(incwage, na.rm = TRUE), 
            med.wage = median(incwage, na.rm = TRUE))

# We can then either print the full set of summary stat values

summary.stats

# Or print specific values as follows

summary.stats$min.wage # minimum wage across the entire sample
summary.stats$max.wage # maximum wage 
summary.stats$med.wage # median wage
```

__6) Calculate the average wage for each year in the data.__

_HINT:_ Take a look at the Group Data section of the `dplyr` cheat sheet. We 
want to group the data by year, then calculate average wages using the 
`summarise()` command.

```{r}
# Now we can see another use for the summarize() function. We can use group_by()
# to tell R that we want to calculate summary stats by year. 

yearly.summary.stats <- sample.data.missings %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(avg.annual.wage = mean(incwage, na.rm = TRUE))

# Now our summary stats data object stores mean values by year

yearly.summary.stats
```
